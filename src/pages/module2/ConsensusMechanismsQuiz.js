        "To speed up transactions",
        "To reduce costs",
        "To ensure agreement on the state of the network",
        "To store data"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Consensus mechanisms are crucial for ensuring all participants in a blockchain network agree on the valid state of the network, preventing double-spending and maintaining integrity."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the main criticism of Proof of Work (PoW) consensus?",
      options: [
        "Too slow",
        "High energy consumption",
        "Too centralized",
        "Lack of security"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The primary criticism of Proof of Work is its high energy consumption due to the computational power required for mining, leading to environmental concerns."
    },
    {
      question: "In Proof of Stake (PoS), how are validators chosen?",
      options: [
        "By solving complex math problems",
        "By random selection",
        "Based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake",
        "By network administrators"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "In PoS, validators are chosen based on the amount of cryptocurrency they stake (lock up) in the network, with larger stakes generally meaning higher chances of being selected."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'nothing at stake' problem in Proof of Stake systems?",
      options: [
        "Validators have no incentive to participate",
        "Validators can validate multiple chain forks without risk",
        "The network has no security",
        "Transactions are too expensive"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "The 'nothing at stake' problem refers to validators potentially validating multiple chain forks simultaneously since it costs them nothing to do so, unlike in PoW where mining requires significant resource investment."
    },
    {
      question: "Which consensus mechanism is typically most suitable for private blockchain networks?",
      options: [
        "Proof of Work",
        "Proof of Authority",
        "Proof of Stake",
        "Delegated Proof of Stake"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Proof of Authority (PoA) is most suitable for private networks as it relies on pre-approved validators, making it efficient and practical for controlled environments where participants are known."
