        "Public ledgers allow anyone to participate",
        "Private ledgers have better security"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "The key distinction is accessibility: public ledgers are open for anyone to participate, while private ledgers restrict access to authorized participants only."

      question: "What is a consortium distributed ledger?",
      options: [
        "A ledger controlled by one organization",
        "A ledger controlled by a group of organizations",
        "A completely open ledger",
        "A ledger without consensus mechanisms"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "A consortium distributed ledger is operated by a group of organizations, balancing decentralization with some level of central control through collaborative governance."

      question: "Which of these is NOT a key characteristic of DLT?",
      options: [
        "Decentralization",
        "Transparency",
        "Central authority control",
        "Consensus-based validation"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Central authority control contradicts the fundamental nature of DLT, which is built on decentralization and distributed consensus rather than centralized control."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the primary advantage of distributed storage in DLT?",
      options: [
        "Lower costs",
        "Faster processing",
        "Improved data availability and redundancy",
        "Simpler maintenance"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 2,
      explanation: "Distributed storage improves data availability and redundancy by replicating data across multiple nodes, making the system more resilient to failures."

      question: "Which industry application of DLT focuses on tracking products from manufacture to delivery?",
      options: [
        "Healthcare records",
        "Supply chain management",
        "Digital voting",
        "Real estate"
      ],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      explanation: "Supply chain management uses DLT to track goods throughout their journey from manufacture to sale, enhancing transparency and reducing fraud in the supply chain."
